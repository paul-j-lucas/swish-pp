.SH NAME
search \- SWISH++ searcher
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B search
.BI [ options ]
.I query
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B search
is the SWISH++ searcher.
It searches a previously generated index for the words specified in a query.
In addition to running from the command-line,
it can run as a daemon process
functioning as a ``search server.''
.SH QUERY INPUT
.SS Query Syntax
The formal grammar of a query is:
.RS 4
.TP 12
.IR query :
.I query relop meta
.br
.I meta
.TP
.IR meta :
.IR meta_name \ \f(CW=\fP\  primary
.br
.I primary
.TP
.IR meta_name :
.I word
.TP
.IR primary :
.RI \f(CW(\fP query \f(CW)\fP
.br
.RI \f(CWnot\fP\  meta
.br
.I word
.br
.IR word \f(CW*\fP
.TP
.IR relop :
\f(CWand\fP
.br
\f(CWnear\fP
.br
\f(CWnot near\fP
.br
\f(CWor\fP
.br
.I (empty)
.RE
.P
In practice, however, the query is the set of words sought after,
possibly restricted to meta data,
and possibly combined with the operators
``\f(CWand\fP,''
``\f(CWor\fP,''
``\f(CWnear\fP,''
``\f(CWnot\fP,''
and
``\f(CWnot near\fP.''
The asterisk (\f(CW*\fP) can be used as a wildcard character
at the end of words.
Note that an asterisk and parentheses are shell meta-characters
and as such must either be escaped (backslashed) or quoted
when passed to a shell.
.P
Although syntactically legal, it is a semantic error to have
``\f(CWnear\fP''
just before
``\f(CWnot\fP''
since such queries are nonsensical,
e.g.:
.cS
mouse near not computer
.cE
Queries are evaluated in left-to-right order, i.e.,
``\f(CWand\fP'' has the same precedence as ``\f(CWor\fP.''
For more about query syntax,
see the EXAMPLES.
.SS Character Mapping and Word Determination
The same character mapping and word determination heuristics used by
.BR index (1)
are used on queries prior to searching.
.SH RESULTS OUTPUT
.SS Result Components
The results are output either in ``classic'' or XML format.
In either case, the components of the results are:
.TP 12
.I rank
An integer from 1 to 100.
.TP
.I path-name
The relative path to where the file was originally indexed.
.TP
.I file-size
The file's size in bytes.
.TP
.I file-title
If the file is of a format that can have titles
(HTML, XHTML, LaTeX, mail, or Unix manual pages)
and the title was extracted, then
.I file-title
is its title;
otherwise, it is its filename.
.SS Classic Results Format
The ``classic'' results format is plain text as:
.cS
.I rank path-name file-size file-title
.cE
It can be parsed easily with:
.cS
($rank,$path,$size,$title) = split( / /, $result, 4 ); # Perl
($rank,$path,$size,$title) = result.split( ' ', 3 )    # Python
.cE
(The separator can be changed via the 
.B \-R
or
.B \-\-separator
options or the
.B ResultSeparator
variable.)
.P
Prior to results lines, comment lines may also appear
containing additional information about the query results.
Comment lines are in the format of:
.cS
# \f2comment-key\fP: \f2comment-value\fP
.cE
The keys and values are:
.RS 4
.TP 24
\f3ignored\fP: \f2stop-words\fP
The list of stop-words (separated by spaces) ignored in the query.
.TP
\f3not found\fP: \f2word\fP
The word was not found in the index.
.TP
\f3results\fP: \f2result-count\fP
The total number of results.
.RE
.SS XML Results Format
The XML results format is given by the DTD:
.cS
<!ELEMENT SearchResults (IgnoredList?, ResultCount, ResultList?)>
<!ELEMENT IgnoredList (Ignored+)>
<!ELEMENT Ignored (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT ResultCount (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT ResultList (File+)>
<!ELEMENT File (Rank, Path, Size, Title)>
<!ELEMENT Rank (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Path (#PCDATA)>
<!ELEMENT Size (#PCDATA)>                                                       <!ELEMENT Title (#PCDATA)>
.cE
and by the XML schema located at:
.cS
http://www.paullucas.org/software/swish/SearchResults/SearchResults.xsd
.cE
For example:
.cS
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="us-ascii"?>

.SH RUNNING AS A DAEMON PROCESS
.SS Description
.B search
can alternatively run as a daemon process
(via either the
.B \-b
or
.B \-\-daemon-type
options or the
.B SearchDaemon
variable)
functioning as a ``search server''
by listening to a Unix domain socket
(specified by either the
.B \-u
or
.B \-\-socket-file
options or the
.B SocketFile
variable),
a TCP socket
(specified by either the
.B \-a
or
.B \-\-socket-address
options or the
.B SocketAddress
variable),
or both.
Unix domain sockets are preferred for both performance and security.
For search-intensive applications,
such as a search engine on a heavily used web site,
this can yield a large performance improvement
since the start-up cost
.RB ( fork (2),
.BR exec (2),
and initialization)
is paid only once.
.P
If the process was started with root privileges,
it will give them away immediately after initialization
and before servicing any requests.
.SS Clients and Requests
Search clients connect to a daemon via a socket
and send a query in the same manner as on the command line
(including the first word being ``\f(CWsearch\f1'').
The only exception is that shell meta-characters
.I "must not"
be escaped (backslashed) since no shell is involved.
Search results are returned via the same socket.
See the EXAMPLES.
.SS Multithreading
A daemon can serve multiple query requests simultaneously
since it is multi-threaded.
When started,
it ``pre-threads'' meaning that it creates a pool of threads in advance
that service an indefinite number of requests
as a further performance improvement
since a thread is not created and destroyed per request.
.P
There is an initial, minimum number of threads in the thread pool.
The number of threads grows dynamically
when there are more requests than threads,
but not more than a specified maximum
to prevent the server from thrashing.
(See the
.BR \-t ,
.BR \-\-min-threads ,
.BR \-T ,
and
.B \-\-max-threads
options or the
.B ThreadsMin
or
.B ThreadsMax
variables.)
If the number of threads reaches the maximum,
subsequent requests are queued until existing threads become available
to service them after completing in-progress requests.
(See either the
.B \-q
or
.B \-\-queue-size
options or the
.B SocketQueueSize
variable.)
.P
If there are more than the minimum number of threads
and some remain idle longer than a specified timeout period
(because the number of requests per unit time has dropped),
then threads will die off until the pool returns to its original minimum size.
(See either the
.B \-O
or
.B \-\-thread-timeout
options or the
.B ThreadTimeout
variable.)
.SS Restrictions
A single daemon can search only a single index.
To search multiple indices concurrently,
multiple daemons can be run,
each searching its own index and using its own socket.
An index
.I "must not"
be modified or deleted while a daemon is using it.
.SH OPTIONS
Options begin with either a `\f(CW-\f1' for short options
or a ``\f(CW--\f1'' for long options.
Either a `\f(CW-\f1' or ``\f(CW--\f1'' by itself explicitly ends the options;
however, the difference is that `\f(CW-\f1' is returned as the first non-option
whereas ``\f(CW--\f1'' is skipped entirely.
Either short or long options may be used.
Long option names may be abbreviated
so long as the abbreviation is unambiguous.
.P
For a short option that takes an argument,
the argument is either taken to be the remaining characters of the same option,
if any, or, if not, is taken from the next option unless said option begins
with a `\f(CW-\f1'.
.P
Short options that take no arguments can be grouped
(but the last option in the group can take an argument), e.g.,
\f(CW-Bq511\fP
is equivalent to
\f(CW-B -q 511\fP.
.P
For a long option that takes an argument,
the argument is either taken to be the characters after a `\f(CW=\fP', if any,
or, if not, is taken from the next option unless said option begins with
a `\f(CW-\fP'.
.TP 8
.BR \-? " | " \-\-help
Prints the usage (``help'') message and exits.
.TP
.BI \-a " a" "\f1 | \fP" "" \-\-socket-address \f1=\fPa
When running as a daemon,
the address,
.IR a , 
to listen to for TCP requests.
(Default is all IP addresses and port 1967.)
The address argument is of the form:
.sp
.RS 12
.ft CW
\f3[\fP\f2host\fP:\f3]\fP\f2port\fP
.ft 1
.RE
.TP 8
.B ""
that is: an optional host and colon
followed by a port number.
The
.I host
may be one of a host name,
an IP address,
or the \f(CW*\f1 character
meaning ``any IP address.''
Omitting the
.I host
and colon also means ``any IP address.''
.TP
.BI \-b " t" "\f1 | \fP" "" \-\-daemon-type \f1=\fPt
Runs as a daemon process.
(Default is not to.)
The type,
.IR t ,
is one of:
.RS
.TP 7
.B none
Same as not specifying the option at all.
(This does not purport to be useful,
but rather consistent with the types that can be specified to the
.B SearchDaemon
variable.)
.TP
.B tcp
Listen on a TCP socket
(see the
.B \-a
option).
.TP
.B unix
Listen on a Unix domain socket
(see the
.B \-u
option).
.TP
.B both
Listen on both.
.RE
.TP 8
.B ""
By default,
if executed from the command-line,
.B search
appears to return immediately;
however, it has merely
detached from the terminal
and
put itself into the background.
There is no need to follow the command with an `\f(CW&\f1'.
.TP
.BR \-B " | " \-\-no-background
When running as a daemon process,
do not detach from the terminal and run in the background.
(Default does.)
.IP ""
The reason not to run in the background
is so a wrapper script can see if the process dies for any reason
and automatically restart it.
.IP ""
This option is implied by the
.B \-X
or
.B \-\-launchd
options.
.TP
.BI \-c " f" "\f1 | \fP" "" \-\-config-file \f1=\fPf
The name of the configuration file,
.IR f ,
to use.
(Default is \f(CWswish++.conf\f1 in the current directory.)
A configuration file is not required:
if none is specified and the default does not exist, none is used;
however, if one is specified and it does not exist, then this is an error.

.SH EXAMPLES
.SS Simple Queries
The query:
.cS
computer mouse
.cE
is the same as and short for:
.cS
computer and mouse
.cE
(because ``\f(CWand\fP'' is implicit)
and would return only those documents that contain both words.
The query:
.cS
cat or kitten or feline
.cE
would return only those documents regarding cats.
The query:
.cS
mouse and computer or keyboard
.cE
is the same as:
.cS
(mouse and computer) or keyboard
.cE
(because queries are evaluated left-to-right)
in that they will both return only those documents
regarding either mice attached to a computer or any kind of keyboard.
However, neither of those is the same as:
.cS
mouse and (computer or keyboard)
.cE
that would return only those documents regarding mice
(including the rodents)
and either a computer or a keyboard. 
.SS Queries Using Wildcards
The query:
.cS
comput*
.cE
would return only those documents that contain words beginning with ``comput''
such as
``computation,''
``computational,''
``computer,''
``computerize,''
``computing,'' and others.
Wildcarded words can be used anywhere ordinary words can be.
The query:
.cS
comput* (medicine or doctor*)
.cE
would return only those documents that contain something about
computer use in medicine or by doctors.
.SS Queries Using ``not''
The query:
.cS
mouse or mice and not computer*
.cE
would return only those documents regarding mice (the rodents)
and not the kind attached to a computer.
.SS Queries Using ``near''
Using ``\f(CWnear\fP'' is the same as using ``\f(CWand\fP''
except that it not only requires both words to be in the documents,
but that they be
.I near
each other, i.e.,
it returns potentially fewer documents
than the corresponding ``\f(CWand\fP'' query.
The query:
.cS
computer near mouse
.cE
would return only those documents where both words are near each other.
They query:
.cS
mouse near (computer or keyboard)
.cE
is the same as:
.cS
(mouse near computer) or (mouse near keyboard)
.cE
i.e., ``near'' gets
.I distributed
across parenthesized subqueries.
.SS Queries Using ``not near''
Using ``\f(CWnot near\fP'' is the same as using ``\f(CWand not\fP''
except that it allows the right-hand side words to be in the documents,
just 
.I "not near"
the left-hand side words, i.e.,
it returns potentially more documents
than the corresponding ``\f(CWand not\fP'' query.
Of course the word(s) on the right-hand side
need not be in the documents at all, i.e.,
they would be considered ``infinitely far'' apart.
The query:
.cS
mouse or mice not near computer*
.cE
would return only those documents regarding mice (the rodents)
more effectively than the query:
.cS
mouse or mice and not computer*
.cE
because the latter would exclude documents about mice (the rodents)
where computers just so happened to be mentioned in the same documents.
.SS Queries Using Meta Data
The query:
.cS
author = hawking
.cE
would return only those documents
whose author attribute contains ``hawking.''
The query:
.cS
author = hawking radiation
.cE
would return only those documents regarding radiation
whose author attribute contains ``hawking.''
The query:
.cS
author = (stephen hawking)
.cE
would return only those documents whose author is Stephen Hawking.
The query:
.cS
author = (stephen hawking) or (black near hole*)
.cE
would return only those documents whose author is Stephen Hawking
or that contain the word ``black'' near ``hole'' or ``holes''
regardless of the author.
Note that the second set of parentheses are necessary
otherwise the query would have been the same as:
.cS
(author = (stephen hawking) or black) near hole*
.cE
that would have additionally required both ``stephen'' and ``hawking''
to be near ``hole'' or ``holes.''
.SS Sending Queries to a Search Daemon
To send a query request to a search daemon using Perl,
first open the socket and connect to the daemon
(see [Wall], pp. 439-440):
.cS
use Socket;

$SocketFile = '/tmp/search.socket';
socket( SEARCH, PF_UNIX, SOCK_STREAM, 0 ) or
	die "can not open socket: $!\\n";
connect( SEARCH, sockaddr_un( $SocketFile ) ) or
	die "can not connect to \\"$SocketFile\\": $!\\n";
.cE
Autoflush
.I must
be set for the socket filehandle
(see [Wall], p. 781),
otherwise the server thread will hang
since I/O buffering will wait for the buffer to fill
that will never happen since queries are short:
.cS
select( (select( SEARCH ), $| = 1)[0] );
.cE
Next, send a query request
(beginning with the word ``search''
and any options just as with a command-line)
to the daemon via the socket filehandle
making sure to include a trailing newline
since the server reads an entire line of input
(so therefore it looks and waits for a newline):
.cS
$query = 'mouse and computer';
print SEARCH "search $query\\n";
.cE
Finally, read the results back and print them:
.cS
print while <SEARCH>;
close( SEARCH );

.SH CAVEATS
.TP 3
1.
Stemming can be done
.B only
when searching through and index of files that are in English
because the Porter stemming algorithm used only stems English words.
.TP
2.
When run as a daemon using a TCP socket,
there are no security restrictions on who may connect and search.
The code to implement domain and IP address restrictions
isn't worth it since such things are better handled by firewalls and routers.
.TP
3.
XML output can currently only be obtained for actual search results
and not word, index, meta-name, or stop-word dumps.
