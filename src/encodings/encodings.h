#ifdef WITH_BASE64
/**
 * Converts a base64-encoded character sequence to its single-character
 * equivalent.  Ideally, we want to decode only a single character, but Base64
 * encoding forces us to decode 3 characters at a time because they are encoded
 * as a unit into 4 bytes.  This makes this code a major pain and slow because
 * characters have to be able to be decoded with random access, i.e., wherever
 * the pointer is positioned.
 *
 * An approach other than the one implemented here would have been to decode
 * the entire range into a buffer in one shot, but this could use a lot of
 * memory if the range is large (and the indexer already uses lots of memory).
 * Additionally, mapping the iterator position from encoded space to decoded
 * space would have been tricky and just as much of a pain.
 *
 * Anywhere a space is returned it's because we've encountered an error
 * condition and the function has to return "something" and a space is
 * innocuous.

 *    Working Group of the Internet Engineering Task Force, November 1996.
 *
 * @param begin A pointer marking the beginning of the entire encoded range.
 * @param c A pointer marking the position of the character to decode.  It is
 * left after the decoded character.
 * @param end A pointer marking the end of the entire encoded range.
 * @return Returns the decoded character or ' ' upon error.
